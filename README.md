# Hugging Face Q&A retrieval

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`huggingface.ipynb`) demonstrates how to use the Hugging Face `transformers` library for text generation, summarization, or other NLP tasks.

 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- `transformers` library
- `torch` (if using PyTorch models)
- `requests` (for API calls)

To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install transformers torch requests
```

 Setup
 1. Get Your Hugging Face API Key
- Sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
- Navigate to `Settings` > `Access Tokens`
- Create an API token

 2. Set Up Your API Key
Set your API key as an environment variable:
```bash
 Windows
set HF_API_KEY=your_api_key

 macOS/Linux
export HF_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

 Usage
 Running the Notebook
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Load `huggingface.ipynb` and execute the cells step by step.

 Features
- Text generation using Hugging Face models
- API-based and local model inference
- Error handling and logging

 Customization
- Modify the prompt in the notebook to fit your use case.
- Change the model used by updating the `model_name` variable.
